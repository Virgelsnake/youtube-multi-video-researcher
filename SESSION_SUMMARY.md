## 🚀 How to Use

### Start All Services
```bash
# Backend
node backend/server.js

# Frontend
npm run dev

# Transcript service
python3 transcript_server.py
```

### Access the App
```
Frontend: http://localhost:5173
Backend:  http://localhost:3000
Transcripts: http://localhost:8082
```

### Run a Search
1. Enter a topic (e.g., "scalping day trading strategies")
2. Click "Start Research"
3. Wait 30-60 seconds
4. View results with all insights
5. Click "Ask Questions" to chat about the research

## 📈 What Makes This Special

### 1. **Depth Over Breadth**
Instead of flat bullet points, you get:
- Strategic principles (the "why")
- Tactical implementations (the "how")
- Common pitfalls (what to avoid)
- Quantitative specifics (exact numbers)
- Points of debate (where experts disagree)

### 2. **Interactive Learning**
- Chat with AI about the research
- Ask follow-up questions
- Get answers with timestamps
- Jump directly to relevant video moments

### 3. **Evidence-Based**
- Every insight shows support count (X/5 videos)
- Specific quotes and evidence provided
- Timestamps for verification
- Links to source videos

### 4. **Actionable Intelligence**
- Not just summaries - actionable insights
- Specific parameters and metrics
- Step-by-step tactical implementations
- Warnings about common mistakes

## 🎯 Use Cases

✅ **Learning New Skills** - Extract best practices from multiple tutorials  
✅ **Research Topics** - Understand consensus and debates  
✅ **Decision Making** - See where experts agree/disagree  
✅ **Time Saving** - Get insights from 5 videos in minutes  
✅ **Deep Dives** - Chat to explore specific aspects

## 🔄 Known Limitations

⚠️ **YouTube Rate Limiting** - yt-dlp may be rate limited temporarily  
   - Solution: Wait a few hours or use VPN  
   - Transcripts work when rate limit clears  

⚠️ **OpenAI Costs** - Each research query costs ~$0.01-0.03  
   - Very affordable for the value provided  
   - Can adjust model or parameters if needed
