## 🚀 Next Steps to Full Production

### 1. Add OpenAI API Key (5 minutes)

```bash
# Edit .env file
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-api-key-here

# Restart backend
# Press Ctrl+C in backend terminal, then:
npm run server
```

**Result**: AI analysis will work, extracting insights from transcripts

### 2. Integrate Playwright MCP (Optional, 30 minutes)

```javascript
// Edit: backend/services/crawlerIntegration.js
// Uncomment the crawlWithPlaywrightMCP function
// Connect to your Playwright MCP server
```

**Result**: Real YouTube crawling instead of mock data

### 3. Deploy to Netlify (30 minutes)

```bash
# Install Netlify CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Login and deploy
netlify login
netlify init
netlify deploy --prod
```

**Result**: Live production app on the internet

### 4. Deploy Transcript Service (20 minutes)

Choose a platform:
- **Render.com** (Recommended, free tier)
- **Railway.app** (Alternative)
- **Heroku** (Paid)

See `DEPLOYMENT.md` for detailed instructions.
