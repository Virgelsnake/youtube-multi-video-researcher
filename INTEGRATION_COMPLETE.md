## 🔧 Technical Details

### Playwright Integration
- **Browser**: Chromium (headless)
- **Viewport**: 1920x1080
- **Wait Strategy**: Network idle + 3s delay
- **Extraction**: DOM queries on ytd-video-renderer
- **Filtering**: Client-side (Shorts, duration, etc.)

### Data Flow
1. User enters query in frontend
2. Frontend calls `/api/research`
3. Backend launches Playwright
4. Playwright navigates to YouTube
5. JavaScript extracts video data
6. Data is parsed and scored
7. Top 5 videos selected
8. Transcripts fetched via Flask service
9. OpenAI analyzes transcripts
10. Consensus generated
11. Results returned to frontend
12. User views and downloads

---

## 📈 Performance

### Typical Research Query
- **Crawling**: 5-10 seconds
- **Transcripts**: 10-30 seconds (5 videos)
- **AI Analysis**: 15-30 seconds
- **Total**: 30-70 seconds

### Resource Usage
- **Memory**: ~200MB (Playwright browser)
- **CPU**: Moderate during crawl
- **Network**: ~5-10MB per query
- **OpenAI Tokens**: ~500-2000 per query
- **Cost**: ~$0.001-0.003 per query
